# Marg's Music Player

## My Approach

-> in designing my solution
-> any additions to UX?
-> around React state management
-> testing (in this case and in general)

## Wish List

## TODO

1. Figure out hover state with border-left
2. Error handling - what if there are no songs? handle at top level/ loading
3. Write tests
4. Figure out how we want to handle being the first song in the list
