# Marg's Music Player

## My Approach

-> in designing my solution
-> any additions to UX?
-> around React state management
-> testing (in this case and in general)

## Wish List

## TODO

1. Shuffle songs
2. create songs played list
3. button copy for play/pause
4. start a new song if "playing" and navigating between songs
